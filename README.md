# Week 1: Chatbot

During the first week of the Technigo web development bootcamp, the task was to build a chatbot with vanilla JS. We worked individually on this project.

## The brief

The focus was to practice our JavaScript skills, using setTimeout, eventListeners and if/else statements to build a control flow. But also to hook it up with the HTML. The bot could be about whatever we wanted. I built a Customer Care Chatbot for an imaginary business.
